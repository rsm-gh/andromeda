![Andromeda GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsm-gh/andromeda/master/usr/share/doc/andromeda/preview.jpeg)

Andromeda is a music player powered by Python3, GTK3 and pyVLC. It has been developed for GNU/Linux Systems and its look and behavior is pretty similar to [Banshee](http://banshee.fm).

Unless you want to try experimental software or contribute to the project you should not yet use it.

## Installation

libgtk-3-0 (>= 3.10), vlc, python3, python3-gi, python3-gi-cairo
